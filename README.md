# Multithreaded_socket_chatroom
socket chatroom with python3 and pyqt4.

My name is Morteza Moradhaseli This is a small project for students or interns that have started learning python or having school projects.

Creating socket in Python 3 enviroment
and having a connection like a chatroom. The server is the first thing connects to a socket after that it stays
online till clients join (as many as it can). Whole process goes through Qt4 and I used PyQt4 as UI
In this project i used sqlite just for ensuring that individual ports connect and having some records
of the connections and their dates.

STEPS for Linux users:

1.Install PyQt4 libraries. It's better to install Qt4 designer or type "sudo apt-get install python-qt4" in Terminal (ctrl + t)

2.Install sqlite3 libraries (libsqlite3-0)

3.run terminal (ctrl +t)

4.go to the directory of you downloaded files

5.run the server "python server.py" if python 2 is your defualt version type "python3 server.py" instead.

6.run client.py same as server
